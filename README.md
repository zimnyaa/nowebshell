The PoC is a simple bind shell with SOCKS5 capabilities that hijacks incoming connections to TCP services instead of listening on its own. It does this by scanning the `/proc` filesystem for connections from whitelisted IPs and using the `pidfd_getfd` Linux syscall to duplicate the file descriptor for the connection.
